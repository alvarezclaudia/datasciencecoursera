Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Description
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
This experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
    Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
    Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
    A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
    Its activity label.
    An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Here are the data for the project:

The variables that correspond to each column found in "tidy.txt", in order of appearance, are as follows...

Variable 1) "subject" the unique identifier given to each of the 30 volunteers

Variable 2) "activity_id" the type of physical activity thus: 1 - WALKING, 2 - WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 - SITTING, 5 - STANDING, 6 - LAYING

Each variable name can thus be understood. The full list of quantitative variable names are as follows:
